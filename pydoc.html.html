            Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. 
            It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code, and these codes are known as scripts. 
            These scripts contain character sets, tokens, and identifiers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <p>A Token is the smallest individual unit in a python program. All statements and instructions in a program are built with tokens.</p>
            <p>Keywords are words that have some special meaning or significance in a programming language.</p> 
            <p>Identifiers are the names given to any variable, function, class, list, methods, etc. for their identification.</p>
            Literals are the fixed values or data items used in a source code, foe ex- string,float,int,complex,boolean,list,tuple,dict,sets.
           <p>The variables on which operation is applied are called operands. Operators can be unary or binary. Unary operators are the ones acting on a single operand like complement operator, etc. While binary operators need two operands to operate.</p>
           <p>These are the symbols that used in Python to organize the structures, statements, and expressions. Some of the Punctuators are: [ ] { } ( ) @  -=  +=  *=  //=  **==  = , etc.</p>

          To get started with writing Python, open the any python notepad and write
          your first "Hello world" python code:
          <code
            >print("Hello_world")
        </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identifiers cannot be a keyword.
          Identifiers are case-sensitive.
          It can have a sequence of letters and digits. However, it must begin with a letter or _. The first letter of an identifier cannot be a digit.
          It's a convention to start an identifier with a letter rather _.
          Whitespaces are not allowed.
          We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, and so on.

        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
          You can declare a variable in these ways:
          <p>
            normally assigining the the value <code> x = 42.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.

        <article>
          <p>
            Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.
            Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            A python constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed throughout the code
          </p>

          <code> PI = 3.14
            #main.py file
            import constant as const
            print('Value of PI:', cons.PI)
          </code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.

        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.
            Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
            Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories</p>
                <li>Text Type: 	str</li>
                <li>
                  Numeric Types: 	int, float, complex
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sequence Types: 	list, tuple, range </li>
                <li>Mapping Type: 	dict
                   </li>
                <li> Set Types: 	set, frozenset
                   </li>
                <li>
                  Boolean Type:bool</li>
                <li>Binary Types: 	bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
                <li>None Type:NoneType</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          Conditional statements in Python play a key role in determining the direction of program execution.
          Among these, If-Else statements are fundamental, providing a way to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.
           As the name suggests, If-Else statements offer two paths, allowing for different outcomes depending on the condition evaluated
          <code>if condition:
            # Statements to execute if
            # condition is true</code>
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it wont.
           But if we want to do something else if the condition is false, we can use the else statement with the if statement Python to execute a block of code when the Python if condition is false. 
          <code>if (condition):
            # Executes this block if
            # condition is true
        else:
            # Executes this block if
            # condition is false</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.

          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>
          Example:
          <p>
            The following while loop iterates as long as x is less than three:
          </p>

          <code>n = 3
                x = 0
               while n>x:
                  print("n")
                  x=+1
                  n+=1
                </code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: x = 1 and n= 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: x = 2 and n = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: x= 3 and n = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the third pass, the condition is no longer
            true, so the loop terminates.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The python statements that define the function, enclosed in
               brackets,( ).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>

          <code> def square(number):
                    return(number*10)
          </code>
          <p>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by 10. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>return 10 * number;</code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
